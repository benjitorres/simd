- Learning about SIMDs since I saw a blogpost saying it's all about physics [https://mcyoung.xyz/2023/11/27/simd-base64/]

- Am taking physics 8A (intro physics) in a few weeks so I wanted to see if I could better do in that class if I focused on learning more about single instruction multiple data

- I don't really know what this is or what I'm doing but what's the worst that could happen?
